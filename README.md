# Interactive_Dashboard_with_Python_Dash_and_Plotly_Introduction

With this set of codes, the full credit goes to Adam and his nice introduction video for Python with Dash and Plotly
The link to the video is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSPmj7mK6ng

You can also find this set of codes on Adam's GitHub page: https://bit.ly/3JldJeH
Adam has many more tutorial videos for Python with Dash and Plotly. You can also follow his great YouTube channel at: https://bit.ly/3Jiyw2F

I did not fork this set of code from Adam's GitHub page because I coded it by hand, line-by-line, after watching his tutorial because I think it's a great opportunity to learn and understand how to get Dash and Plotly to work with Python.

#NOTE: For the code to fully run, make sure that debug=False on the last line.
